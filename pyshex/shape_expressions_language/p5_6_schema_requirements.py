""" Implemention of `5.6 Schema Requirements <http://shex.io/shex-semantics/#schema-requirements>`_

The semantics defined above assume two structural requirements beyond those imposed by the grammar of the
abstract syntax. These ensure referential integrity and eliminate logical paradoxes such as those that arrise
through the use of negation. These are not constraints expressed by the schema but instead those imposed on
the schema.
